- The Student Grade Calculation System is a simple console-based Java application that computes the total marks, average percentage, and grade based on the marks entered by the user. It provides an easy way for students to check their performance and understand their grades.

🎯 **Project Overview**
- The system prompts the user to input marks for 5 subjects.

- It calculates the total marks and average percentage.

- Based on the average, it assigns a grade following these criteria:

- A: 90% and above

- B: 80% – 89%

- C: 70% – 79%

- D: 60% – 69%

- E: 50% – 59%

- Fail: Below 50%

⚙️ **How It Works**
- The user inputs marks for 5 subjects.

- The system calculates the total and average percentage.

- It evaluates the average and displays the corresponding grade.

- The final grade and results are displayed neatly with a formatted output.
